### "Investigating Entity Knowledge in BERT with Simple Neural End-To-End Entity Linking"  

This repository contains the code for the CONLL 2019 paper [**"Investigating Entity Knowledge in BERT with Simple Neural End-To-End Entity Linking"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05473). The code is provided as a documentation for the paper and for follow up research on the topic.

The code relevant for this project consists of three topics: 

- Preprocessing of Wikipedia and the AIDA-CONLL entity linking benchmark into a sequence tagging format.
- Finetuning or training a BERT-Entity model on Wikipedia and the AIDA-CONLL entity linking benchmark
- Using a BERT-Entity model in a downstream task

##### Preprocessing



##### Training

##### Evalation on downstream tasks
